ROS 2 provides powerful command-line tools for introspecting running systems. These tools are essential for debugging and understanding complex robot architectures.

  

### **Inspecting Your System**

  

While your temperature system is running, open a new terminal and source your workspace:

  

```bash

source  ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash

```

  

**Listing Nodes:**

  

List all active nodes:

  

```bash

ros2  node  list

```

  

You should see:

```

/temperature_sensor

/temperature_monitor

```

  

**Listing Topics:**

  

See all active topics:

  

```bash

ros2  topic  list

```

  

You'll see the `/temperature` topic along with some system topics that ROS 2 creates automatically.

  

**Inspecting Topic Info:**

  

Get detailed information about a topic:

  

```bash

ros2  topic  info  /temperature

```

  

This shows the message type (`std_msgs/msg/Float32`), number of publishers, and number of subscribers.

  

**Monitoring Messages:**

  

Listen to messages on a topic in real-time:

  

```bash

ros2  topic  echo  /temperature

```

  

You'll see temperature readings streaming by as they're published. This is invaluable for debugging—you can verify that data is flowing without writing any code.

  

**Publishing Manually:**

  

You can even publish messages from the command line:

  

```bash

ros2  topic  pub  /temperature  std_msgs/msg/Float32  "data: 30.5"

```

  

Your monitor node will receive and process this message just like any other.

  

**Viewing the Node Graph:**

  

Install `rqt_graph`, a visualization tool:

  

```bash

sudo  apt  install  ros-humble-rqt-graph

```

  

Run it:

  

```bash

rqt_graph

```

  

This displays a visual graph showing nodes (ovals) and topics (rectangles) with arrows indicating the flow of data. It's incredibly useful for understanding complex systems at a glance.

  

These tools—`ros2 node`, `ros2 topic`, `ros2 service`, `rqt_graph`, and others—form your diagnostic toolkit. Master them, and you'll debug robot systems efficiently.
