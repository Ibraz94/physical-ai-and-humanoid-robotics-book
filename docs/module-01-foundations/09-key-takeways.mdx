You've now mastered the foundational concepts of ROS 2:

  

-  **Nodes** are independent processes responsible for specific tasks, forming a distributed system

-  **Topics** enable publish-subscribe communication for continuous data streams

-  **Services** provide request-response patterns for synchronous operations

-  **Actions** handle long-running tasks with feedback and cancellation

-  **URDF** describes robot physical structure in a standardized format

-  **rclpy** bridges Python AI code to ROS 2 infrastructure

-  **Best practices** ensure maintainable, scalable robot systems

  

ROS 2 is your robotic nervous system—the communication backbone that connects sensors, actuators, AI models, and planning algorithms into functioning robots. Every component you build from here forward will leverage these primitives.

  

In the next module, we'll move from abstract communication patterns to concrete simulation. You'll create photorealistic virtual environments where robots can be tested, trained, and refined before ever touching physical hardware. You'll build digital twins—perfect replicas of robots that behave according to physical laws.

  

The foundation is laid. Now let's build worlds.
