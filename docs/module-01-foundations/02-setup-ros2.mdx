### **Installation and Setup**

  

Before we write any code, let's get ROS 2 installed and configured on your system.

  

**Prerequisites:**

  

ROS 2 runs natively on Linux (Ubuntu specifically), with experimental support for Windows and macOS. For this book, we strongly recommend **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**, which has official support for ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill—the long-term support release we'll use throughout.

  

If you're on Windows, consider setting up a dual-boot Linux partition or using Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2). If you're on macOS, you'll need to use a virtual machine or switch to Linux hardware for serious development.

  

**Installation Steps:**

  

First, ensure your system is updated:

  

```bash

sudo  apt  update

sudo  apt  upgrade

```

  

Add the ROS 2 repository to your system:

  

```bash

sudo  apt  install  software-properties-common

sudo  add-apt-repository  universe

sudo  apt  update && sudo  apt  install  curl  -y

sudo  curl  -sSL  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key  -o  /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg

echo  "deb [arch=$(dpkg  --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo  $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo  tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null

```

  

Install ROS 2 Humble (desktop version includes visualization tools):

  

```bash

sudo  apt  update

sudo  apt  install  ros-humble-desktop

```

  

This installation includes the core ROS 2 libraries, command-line tools, common message types, and visualization tools like RViz. It may take 10-15 minutes depending on your connection speed.

  

After installation, you need to "source" the ROS 2 environment in every terminal where you'll use ROS 2:

  

```bash

source  /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

```

  

To avoid typing this every time, add it to your shell configuration:

  

```bash

echo  "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

source  ~/.bashrc

```

  

Verify the installation by checking the ROS 2 version:

  

```bash

ros2  --version

```

  

You should see output indicating ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill.

  

**Installing Additional Tools:**

  

You'll also need `colcon`, the build tool for ROS 2 packages:

  

```bash

sudo  apt  install  python3-colcon-common-extensions

```

  

And install `rosdep`, which manages dependencies:

  

```bash

sudo  apt  install  python3-rosdep

sudo  rosdep  init

rosdep  update

```

  

Congratulations—you now have a fully functional ROS 2 development environment.
