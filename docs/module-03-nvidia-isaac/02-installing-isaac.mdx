## **Chapter 2 - Installing and Setting Up Isaac Sim**

  

### **Prerequisites Check**

  

Before installation, verify your system meets requirements:

  

```bash

# Check GPU

nvidia-smi

# Should show RTX-series GPU with driver 525+

  

# Check CUDA version

nvcc  --version

# CUDA 11.8 or 12.x required

```

  

**If drivers are outdated:**

  

```bash

# Add NVIDIA driver repository

sudo  add-apt-repository  ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa

sudo  apt  update

  

# Install latest driver

sudo  ubuntu-drivers  install

  

# Reboot

sudo  reboot

```

  

After reboot, verify:

  

```bash

nvidia-smi

# Should show updated driver and GPU info

```

  

### **Installing NVIDIA Omniverse**

  

Isaac Sim runs on Omniverse, NVIDIA's platform for 3D simulation.

  

**Download Omniverse Launcher:**

  

Visit [nvidia.com/omniverse](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/)

  

```bash

# Make installer executable

chmod  +x  omniverse-launcher-linux.AppImage

  

# Run installer

./omniverse-launcher-linux.AppImage

```

  

**Install Isaac Sim:**

  

1. Open Omniverse Launcher

2. Navigate to "Exchange" tab

3. Search for "Isaac Sim"

4. Click "Install"

5. Select version 2023.1.1 or newer

6. Wait for installation (15-30 minutes, ~50GB)

  

### **First Launch**

  

1. In Omniverse Launcher → "Library"

2. Find Isaac Sim

3. Click "Launch"

  

Isaac Sim opens with a default scene. The interface:

  

-  **Viewport (center):** 3D scene with ray-traced rendering

-  **Stage (left):** Hierarchical list of objects

-  **Property (right):** Selected object properties

-  **Content Browser (bottom):** Asset library

-  **Toolbar (top):** Simulation controls

  

### **Loading Example Scene**

  

Test your installation:

  

1. File → Open

2. Navigate to Isaac Sim examples

3. Open: `Isaac/Environments/Simple_Warehouse/warehouse.usd`

  

You should see a detailed warehouse with photorealistic rendering. Press **Play** (spacebar) to start physics simulation.

  

**Performance Optimization:**

  

If simulation is slow:

  

**Reduce rendering quality:**

- Viewport → Render Settings

- Set "Samples per Pixel" to 1-2 (default is 4)

- Disable "RTX Real-Time" if needed

  

**Adjust physics:**

- Edit → Preferences → Physics

- Decrease "Num Substeps" if too slow

- Increase "Time Steps Per Second" if unstable

  

### **Understanding USD Format**

  

Isaac Sim uses **USD (Universal Scene Description)**, Pixar's format for 3D scenes.

  

**USD advantages over URDF:**

- Complex visual effects (ray tracing, advanced materials)

- Large-scale scenes (millions of objects)

- Non-destructive layering

- Animation and sequencing

  

URDF files can be imported and converted to USD, preserving physics while adding rendering capabilities.

  

### **Verifying Installation**

  

Create a simple test:

  

1. Create → Shape → Sphere

2. Position at (0, 0, 2)

3. Press Play

  

The sphere should fall and bounce realistically. If it does, your installation is working!
